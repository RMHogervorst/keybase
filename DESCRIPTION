Description: 'Keybase' <keybase.io> is a directory of people and public keys and provides
    methods for obtaining public keys, validating users and exchanging files and/or messages
    in a secure fashion. Tools are provided to search for and retrieve information about
    'Keybase' users, retrieve and import user public keys and list and/or download files.
    There's also a thin but useful R wrapper around many of they `keybase` command-line
    utility functions.
